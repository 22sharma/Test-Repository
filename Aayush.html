<p style="color: aliceblue;"> I am a person that likes to try new things. I  play soccer, basketball, 
and I wrestle. I am learning how to play the guitar in my free time. Another thing I

<h3 style="color: darkcyan;">What business would you start?</h3>

<p style="color: aliceblue;"> If I could start any business I would probably like to do something like 
have a company that makes websites for clients. Another thing I would like to 
do is make apps that become popular. These could be anything from a simple app 
that helps make a certain task more effficient to creating games.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkcyan;">What do you want out of life?</h3>

<p style="color: aliceblue;"> I want to find ways to challenge myself as much as I can so I can grow as a person
and try to experience as many new things as I can. I also want to meet new people who 
I can have genuine relations with. Finally, I want to be successful and be able to live a
comfortable life. 

<h3 style="color: darkcyan;"> How are you going to obtain the things you want out of life?</h3>

<p style="color: aliceblue;"> I am going to obtain these things by working hard and giving my best in everything I do.
I will also treat others with respect and push myself to try new things as often as I can.</p>
